    ## Upholstery Cleaning

    Modern cleans all upholstery in your home. From couches and recliners to dining room chairs. Our Technicians have been trained to bring your furniture back to life using the proper tools and cleaning agents. I consider our service the best value because we include a scotchguard like fabric protector in our price.

    Our five step upholstery cleaning process cleans your furniture and fabrics without damaging them. Every step helps get your items cleaner and helps them stay cleaner longer.
